# 🚌 Edmonton Transit System Route Viewer

This project is a Python-based application that loads, visualizes, and interacts with **Edmonton Transit System (ETS)** data. It provides both a command-line and graphical interface for exploring bus route information and traffic disruptions.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Project 2.py` – Main program script containing all required functionalities  
- `edmonton_map.png` – Base map image for graphical display  
- `routes.txt`, `trips.txt`, `shapes.txt`, `traffic_disruptions.txt` – Required ETS data files (should be placed in a `data/` folder)  
- `etsdata.p` – Optional saved pickle file (generated by the program)

## 💡 Features

### ✅ Menu Overview
```text
Edmonton Transit System
---------------------------------
(1) Load route data
(2) Load shapes data
(3) Load disruptions data
(4) Print shape IDs for a route
(5) Print coordinates for a shape ID
(6) Find longest shape for route
(7) Save routes, shapes and disruptions in a pickle
(8) Load routes, shapes and disruptions from a pickle
(9) Interactive map
(0) Quit
```

### ✔️ Functionality Breakdown

- **Option 1**: Load ETS trip and route data.
- **Option 2**: Load shape IDs and corresponding geographic coordinates.
- **Option 3**: Load traffic disruption information and convert finish dates into Python `date` objects.
- **Option 4**: Display all shape IDs linked to a selected route.
- **Option 5**: Display coordinate points for a given shape ID.
- **Option 6**: Determine and display the longest route shape by number of coordinates.
- **Option 7**: Save all loaded data (routes, shapes, disruptions) to a `.p` pickle file.
- **Option 8**: Load previously saved data from a pickle file.
- **Option 9**: Launch an interactive graphical map with route plotting and disruption markers.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Data is cleaned and parsed from structured text files.
- Route and shape data are stored in dictionary-based structures for efficient access.
- Traffic disruptions are processed and finish dates are stored using the `datetime.date` class.
- The graphical interface is created using the `graphics.py` library.
- The map plots both disruptions and routes with geographic accuracy using a custom coordinate system.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Requirements**:  
   Python 3.11 or higher is recommended. Uses the `graphics` module (install if needed).

2. **Prepare the Data**:  
   Place `trips.txt`, `routes.txt`, `shapes.txt`, and `traffic_disruptions.txt` inside a folder named `data`.

3. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   python Project\ 2.py
   ```

## 📦 Saving & Loading

- Use option **7** to save loaded data into a binary `.p` file.
- Use option **8** to reload that data later.

## 📍 Coordinate Mapping

The program uses the following geographic bounds for the Edmonton region:
```python
win.setCoords(-113.720049, 53.393703, -113.320418, 53.657116)
```
All disruptions and routes are plotted accurately within this coordinate system.
